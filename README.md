# Genetic Algorithm for Synopses Generator

## About

This is a free software made to optimize the [Trajectory Synopses Generator](https://github.com/DataStories-UniPi/Trajectory-Synopses-Generator) developed by Kostas Patroumpas (UPRC). It is written in Python 3 and uses a Genetic Algorithm to automatically "learn" the best parameters for a ship type in a dataset.



## Usage

To learn how to run the system, see the ReadMe in each folder (mainly in folder ```parameter_optimizer/scripts```).

This repository should be placed in folder ```~/infore/Genetic-Algorithm-for-Synopses-Generator/```, i.e. this files location should be ```~/infore/Genetic-Algorithm-for-Synopses-Generator/README.md```. Flink should also be installed in the directory ```~/infore/```.
