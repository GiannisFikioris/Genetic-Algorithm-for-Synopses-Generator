## Synopses Generator

* The original code for the Synopses Generator can be found [here](https://github.com/DataStories-UniPi/Trajectory-Synopses-Generator). The main difference is that Kafka has been removed.

* To compile all the code at once run the python3 script ```make.py```. In order for the compile to work first run the installation instructions in ```trajectory_synopses/ReadMe - Original Code.txt```.
